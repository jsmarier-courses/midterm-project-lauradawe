## Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Project Description:**
This project was to uncover insights, patterns, and trends with storytelling potential based on data taken from service calls to the City of Ottawa. 

**Data sources:**
The data was extracted from the City of Ottawa Open Data Portal and was a subset of data containing 28,539 entries covering the period between August 1 and September 1, 2024. 

**Methodology:**
The methodology used to clean the data was primarily linear using a vimo analysis, google sheets tools, and open refine. 

**Key observations and takeaways:** 

Garbage and recycling services account for the majority of service requests, representing 35.94% of all calls; the distribution of service calls was relatively even between Ottawa's 24 wards; and the majority of calls came in by dispatch or web.
